# Railway Reservation System - Abstract

## Overview
The Railway Reservation System is a console-based application developed in Java that simulates the core functionalities of a railway booking system. This system provides a streamlined solution for managing train reservations, passenger information, and ticket bookings through a command-line interface.

## System Architecture

The system follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

### Model Layer
- **Train**: Encapsulates train-specific attributes (train number, name, capacity, route)
- **Passenger**: Manages passenger details (name, age, gender, contact information)
- **Ticket**: Handles booking information (PNR, journey details, seat allocation)
- **Payment**: Processes payment transactions and maintains payment records
- **Station**: Maintains station-related information (code, name, location)

### Service Layer
- **ReservationService**: Core business logic for ticket booking and cancellation
- **TrainService**: Manages train operations and scheduling
- **PassengerService**: Handles passenger registration and profile management
- **PaymentService**: Manages payment processing and transaction records

## Key Features

### Train Management
- Train schedule maintenance
- Seat availability tracking
- Route management
- Train status updates

### Passenger Operations
- Passenger registration
- Profile management
- Booking history tracking
- Personal information updates

### Reservation System
- Ticket booking with seat allocation
- PNR generation and status tracking
- Cancellation processing
- Waiting list management

### Payment Processing
- Secure payment handling
- Receipt generation
- Refund processing
- Transaction history

## Technical Implementation

### Design Patterns
- Singleton Pattern: For service classes to ensure single instances
- Factory Pattern: For creating different types of tickets and payments
- Observer Pattern: For notification system
- Strategy Pattern: For different payment methods

### Data Management
- In-memory data structures for prototype phase
- Extensible design for future database integration

## Constraints and Limitations
- Console-based interface
- Single-user operation
- Limited to basic booking operations
- In-memory data storage (no persistence)

## Future Enhancements
1. Graphical User Interface
2. Multi-user support
3. Database integration
4. Real-time train tracking
5. Email notification system
6. Mobile application interface
7. Online payment gateway integration

## Project Status
The system is currently in development phase with core features being implemented. The modular architecture allows for easy extension and enhancement of functionalities in future iterations.
